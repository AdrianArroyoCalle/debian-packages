Description: Crazy Eddie's GUI
 CEGUI is a free library providing windowing and widgets for graphics APIs and engines where such functionality is not natively available or is severely lacking. The library is written in C++, is object oriented, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be spending their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems
